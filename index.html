                Hi! My name is Nestor. I'm a CCSU Graduate who majored in Psychology. I enjoy anime, reading manga and playing video games. Some of my favorites are the Resident Evil franchise and Call of Duty. I'm hoping to take the most out of this Bootcamp and have an impactful career change in my life.

            <P>
            For my first assignment of Bootcamp I was "hired" by a marketing agency to help refactored existing code to make more accesible for it's users. This involved changing a lot of div tags to other semantic element tags to help better stucture the site for other coders to comprehend. I also helped by fixing a broken link on the site and adding alt attributes to help with accessiblity. Finally, I changed the title to something more original and descriptive than "website".
            </P>
