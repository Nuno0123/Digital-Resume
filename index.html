                Hi! My name is Nestor. I'm a CCSU Graduate who majored in Psychology. I enjoy anime, reading manga and playing video games. Some of my favorites are the Resident Evil franchise and Call of Duty. I'm hoping to take the most out of this Bootcamp and have an impactful career change in my life.

            <P>
            For my first assignment of Bootcamp I was "hired" by a marketing agency to help refactored existing code to make more accesible for it's users. This involved changing a lot of div tags to other semantic element tags to help better stucture the site for other coders to comprehend. I also helped by fixing a broken link on the site and adding alt attributes to help with accessiblity. Finally, I changed the title to something more original and descriptive than "website".
            </P>

            <P>
            For my first project of Bootcamp I was placed in a group of 4 with 3 other classmates. We had to come up with a website that use another CSS framework other than Bootstrap, to use at least two server-side APIs, create a local storage within the webpage and finally, make the webpage a responsive layout that adapts to different viewpoints

     <!--At the beginning of this project it seemed really scary and I wasn't sure what to do, I did use my first assignment as a guide to help me build a structure in both html and css. I'm citing the website (https://nuno0123.github.io/Challenge-one-Horiseon/) to my first assignment just as a courtesy, giving it credit for it helping me and in case there are any similarities between them, like the links I created on the top right corner of my website wouldn't have came to been if I did get the idea by studying my previous assignment.-->
